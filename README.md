### Complex System Simulation

Usage:
```
pip3 install -r requirements
```

Run the following **inside the `src` directory** to show the animation directly and save it after:
```
python3 run.py -n 100 -r testrun -a -s
```
or run the following for logging (outputting intermediate data)
```
python3 run.py -n 100 -r testrun2 -l
```

or see help for more information:
```
python3 run.py -h
```

Check requirements.txt for required packages or use the prespecified pipenv.
Please note no immediate visualization of the animation is possible while using pipenv.
